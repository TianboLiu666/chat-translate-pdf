# Chat-Translate PDFs

This is a web application where you can chat with or translate your PDFs.  Ask questions about, summarizing part or whole of the PDFs, ChatGPT on the backend will answer them.  You can also translate your PDFs into other languages.

There are two ways to upload you PDFs, you can drop you file directly from you computer or you can paste the PDF URL, for example, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12966.pdf.  Note the URL has to start with http and end with .pdf.
